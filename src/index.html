            <section data-title="Slide with limited width" class="limit-width">
                This is slide three. It's width is limited to maximum 50em thanks to
                 the CSS class „limit-width”. This especially makes long paragraphs
                 like this one, that just refuse to end, easier to read. Because
                 longer lines make continuous text really hard to grasp. They might
                 even distract to a point where a reader has troubles remembering all
                 that he/she read so far.
