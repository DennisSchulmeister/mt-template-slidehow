mini-tutorial.js template project
=================================

Getting Started
---------------

This is the recommended project structure for a `mini-tutorial.js` document.
Simply download this repository and start hacking it. It couldn't be easier. :-)

 * Download this repository (__Clone or download » Download ZIP__)
 * Extract anywhere on your computer
 * Install needed packages
 * Hack away

Use the following commands while working on a document:

 * `npm install` to install all dependencies
 * `npm run start` to open a browser for a live preview
 * `npm run build` to build a static version for uploading on a webserver
 * `npm run watch` to rebuild after each change without starting a local server
 * `npm run clean` to just clean the dist directory

The project may contain as many documents as you like. Each one of them is
just a HTML file in the `src` directory. See `src/index.html` for an example.

Screenshot

And here comes the obligatory screenshot. This is just a simple layout for a
slideshow persentation.
